## Problem 1
```{r}
bday = function(n) {

  bdays = sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  
  duplicate = length(unique(bdays)) < n

  return(duplicate)
  
}

bday_samp = 
  expand_grid(
    n = 2:50,
    iter = 1:10000
  ) |> 
  mutate(res = map_lgl(n, bday)) |> 
  group_by(n) |> 
  summarize(prob = mean(res))

bday_samp |>
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = prob)) + 
  geom_line()
```

The probability that at least two people in the group will share a birthday increasing with group size. Around group size of 23, the probability exceeds 50%.

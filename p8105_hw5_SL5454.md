## Problem 1

``` r
bday = function(n) {

  bdays = sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  
  duplicate = length(unique(bdays)) < n

  return(duplicate)
  
}

bday_samp = 
  expand_grid(
    n = 2:50,
    iter = 1:10000
  ) |> 
  mutate(res = map_lgl(n, bday)) |> 
  group_by(n) |> 
  summarize(prob = mean(res))

bday_samp |>
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = prob)) + 
  geom_line()
```

The probability that at least two people in the group will share a
birthday increasing with group size. Around group size of 23, the
probability exceeds 50%.

## Problem 2

``` r
t_test = function(n = 30, sigma = 5, mu) {
  
  data = rnorm(n, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
  
  ttest_result = t.test(data, mu = 0, conf.level = 0.95) |>
    broom::tidy()
  
  return(ttest_result)
}

set.seed(123)
mu_df = 
  expand_grid(
    mu = 0:6,
    iter = 1:5000
  ) |>
  mutate(output = map(mu, ~t_test(mu = .x))) |>
  unnest(output)
```

Repeat mu = 0:6

``` r
rejected =
  mu_df |>
  group_by(mu) |>
  summarize(
    power = mean(p.value < 0.05),
    avg_est = mean(estimate),
    avg_reject = mean(estimate[p.value < 0.05])
  )
```

### Plot 2.1

``` r
rejected |>
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = power)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Power of t-test vs. True Value of mu",
       x = "mu",
       y = "Power") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The plot shows that the greater the effective size the larger the power
of this t test.

### Plot 2.2

``` r
rejected |>
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = avg_est)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() + 
  labs(title = "Average Estimate vs. True Value",
       x = "True Value of mu",
       y = "Average Estimate of mu")
```

![](p8105_hw5_SL5454_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
rejected |>
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = avg_reject)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Average Estimate in Rejected vs. True Value",
       x = "True Value of mu",
       y = "Average Estimate of mu with Rejected Null")
```

The estimates for samples where the null was rejected tend to be higher
than the true Œº, especially for smaller effect sizes. Thus, the sample
average ofùúáÃÇ across tests for which the null is rejected approximately
equal to the true value of Œº, but the sample mean ùúáÃÇ differs from the
true value Œº when Œº \< 4.
